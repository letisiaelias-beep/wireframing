# Wireframing in Software Development #

Wireframing is the process of creating a skeletal framework of a website or application.  
It helps visualize the layout, structure, and functionality of a product before moving to design and development.  
This step is crucial in the UI/UX process as it ensures clarity, reduces risks, and aligns the team on the final vision.

## Key Elements of Wireframing  

|1. |Layout Structure| Defines where elements (buttons, menus, forms) will be placed on the screen.|  
   *Example: A header at the top, content in the middle, footer at the bottom.*  
|--------|--------|
2. **Navigation** – Shows how users move through the app/site (menus, links, tabs).  
   *Example: A navigation bar that lets users switch between Home, Profile, and Settings.*  

3. **Content Placement** – Indicates where text, images, and media will appear.  
   *Example: Product descriptions on the left, product image on the right.*  

4. **Functionality** – Demonstrates interactive elements like buttons or search bars.  
   *Example: A “Sign Up” button linked to a registration form.*
