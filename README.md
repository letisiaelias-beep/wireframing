# Wireframing in Software Development
Wireframing is the process of creating a skeletal framework of a website or application.  
It helps visualize the layout, structure, and functionality of a product before moving to design and development.  
This step is crucial in the UI/UX process as it ensures clarity, reduces risks, and aligns the team on the final vision.

## Key Elements of Wireframing  

1. **Layout Structure** – Defines where elements (buttons, menus, forms) will be placed on the screen.  
   *Example: A header at the top, content in the middle, footer at the bottom.*
   
3. **Navigation** – Shows how users move through the app/site (menus, links, tabs).  
   *Example: A navigation bar that lets users switch between Home, Profile, and Settings.*  

4. **Content Placement** – Indicates where text, images, and media will appear.  
   *Example: Product descriptions on the left, product image on the right.*  

5. **Functionality** – Demonstrates interactive elements like buttons or search bars.  
   *Example: A “Sign Up” button linked to a registration form.*

## Types of Wireframes  

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
  Simple sketches or outlines focusing only on structure and flow.  
  *Use case: Early brainstorming sessions.*  

- **High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
  Detailed, polished versions with colors, typography, and near-final design.  
  *Use case: Later stages before prototyping.*

### Type of Wireframe  

The wireframe created in Figma is a **High-Fidelity Wireframe**.  
It includes real images, colors, navigation icons, text fields, and styled buttons, making it very close to the final user interface.  
This type of wireframe is useful for usability testing and presenting to stakeholders, as it clearly communicates the look and feel of the final app.
